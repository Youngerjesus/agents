      "{'Abstract': 'Large language models are trained in two stages: (1) unsupervised pretraining from raw text, to learn general-purpose representations, and (2) large scale instruction tuning and reinforcement learning, to better align to end tasks and user preferences. We measure the relative importance of these two stages by training LIMA, a 65B parameter LLaMa language model fine-tuned with the standard supervised loss on only 1,000 carefully curated prompts and responses, without any reinforcement learning or human preference modeling. LIMA demonstrates remarkably strong performance, learning to follow specific response formats from only a handful of examples in the training data, including complex queries that range from planning trip itineraries to speculating about alternate history. Moreover, the model tends to generalize well to unseen tasks that did not appear in the training data. In a controlled human study, responses from LIMA are either equivalent or strictly preferred to GPT-4 in $43\\\\%$ of cases; this statistic is as high as $58\\\\%$ when compared to Bard and $65\\\\%$ versus DaVinci003, which was trained with human feedback. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that almost all knowledge in large language models is learned during pretraining, and only limited instruction tuning data is necessary to teach models to produce high quality output.', '1 Introduction': 'Language models are pretrained to predict the next token at an incredible scale, allowing them to learn general-purpose representations that can be transferred to nearly any language understanding or generation task. To enable this transfer, various methods for aligning language models have thus been proposed, primarily focusing on instruction tuning [Mishra et al., 2021, Wei et al., 2022a, Sanh et al., 2022] over large multi-million-example datasets [Chung et al., 2022, Beeching et al., 2023, Köpf et al., 2023], and more recently reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [Bai et al., 2022a, Ouyang et al., 2022], collected over millions of interactions with human annotators. Existing alignment methods require significant amounts of compute and specialized data to achieve ChatGPT-level performance. However, we demonstrate that, given a strong pretrained language model, remarkably strong performance can be achieved by simply fine-tuning on 1,000 carefully curated training examples.  \\n\\nWe hypothesize that alignment can be a simple process where the model learns the style or format for interacting with users, to expose the knowledge and capabilities that were already acquired during pretraining. To test this hypothesis, we curate 1,000 examples that approximate real user prompts and high-quality responses. We select 750 top questions and answers from community forums, such as Stack Exchange and wikiHow, sampling for quality and diversity. In addition, we manually write 250 examples of prompts and responses, while optimizing for task diversity and emphasizing a uniform response style in the spirit of an AI assistant. Finally, we train LIMA, a pretrained 65B-parameter LLaMa model [Touvron et al., 2023] fine-tuned on this set of 1,000 demonstrations.  \\n\\n<html><body><table><tr><td>Source</td><td>#Examples</td><td>Avg Input Len.</td><td>AvgOutputLen.</td></tr><tr><td>Training</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Stack Exchange (STEM)</td><td>200</td><td>117</td><td>523</td></tr><tr><td>Stack Exchange (Other)</td><td>200</td><td>119</td><td>530</td></tr><tr><td>wikiHow</td><td>200</td><td>12</td><td>1,811</td></tr><tr><td>Pushshift r/WritingPrompts</td><td>150</td><td>34</td><td>274</td></tr><tr><td>NaturalInstructions</td><td>50</td><td>236</td><td>92</td></tr><tr><td>Paper Authors (Group A)</td><td>200</td><td>40</td><td>334</td></tr><tr><td>Dev Paper Authors (Group A)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td>50</td><td>36</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Test</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Pushshiftr/AskReddit</td><td>70</td><td>30</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Paper Authors (Group B)</td><td>230</td><td>31</td><td>N/A</td></tr></table></body></html>\\n\\nTable 1: Sources of training prompts (inputs) and responses (outputs), and test prompts. The total amount of training data is roughly 750,000 tokens, split over exactly 1,000 sequences.  \\n\\nWe compare LIMA to state-of-the-art language models and products across 300 challenging test prompts. In a human preference study, we find that LIMA outperforms RLHF-trained DaVinci003 from OpenAI, which was trained with RLHF, as well as a 65B-parameter reproduction of Alpaca [Taori et al., 2023], which was trained on 52,000 examples. While humans typically prefer responses from GPT-4, Claude, and Bard over LIMA, this is not always the case; LIMA produces equal or preferrable responses in $43\\\\%$ , $46\\\\%$ , and $58\\\\%$ of the cases, respectively. Repeating the human preference annotations with GPT-4 as the annotator corroborates our findings. Analyzing LIMA responses on an absolute scale reveals that $88\\\\%$ meet the prompt requirements, and $50\\\\%$ are considered excellent.  \\n\\nAblation experiments reveal vastly diminishing returns when scaling up data quantity without also scaling up prompt diversity, alongside major gains when optimizing data quality. In addition, despite having zero dialogue examples, we find that LIMA can conduct coherent multi-turn dialogue, and that this ability can be dramatically improved by adding only 30 hand-crafted dialogue chains to the training set. Overall, these remarkable findings demonstrate the power of pretraining and its relative importance over large-scale instruction tuning and reinforcement learning approaches.', '2 Alignment Data': 'We define the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis: A model’s knowledge and capabilities are learnt almost entirely during pretraining, while alignment teaches it which subdistribution of formats should be used when interacting with users. If this hypothesis is correct, and alignment is largely about learning style, then a corollary of the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis is that one could sufficiently tune a pretrained language model with a rather small set of examples [Kirstain et al., 2021].  \\n\\nTo that end, we collect a dataset of 1,000 prompts and responses, where the outputs (responses) are stylistically aligned with each other, but the inputs (prompts) are diverse. Specifically, we seek outputs in the style of a helpful AI assistant. We curate such examples from a variety of sources, primarily split into community Q&A forums and manually authored examples. We also collect a test set of 300 prompts and a development set of 50. Table 1 shows an overview of the different data sources and provides some statistics (see Appendix A for a selection of training examples).', '2.1 Community Questions & Answers': 'We collect data from three community Q&A websites: Stack Exchange, wikiHow, and the Pushshift Reddit Dataset [Baumgartner et al., 2020]. Largely speaking, answers from Stack Exchange and wikiHow are well-aligned with the behavior of a helpful AI agent, and can therefore be mined automatically, whereas highly upvoted Reddit answers tend to be humorous or trolling, requiring a more manual approach to curate responses that follow the appropriate style.  \\n\\nStack Exchange Stack Exchange contains 179 online communities (exchanges), each one dedicated to a specific topic, with the most popular one being programming (Stack Overflow). Users can post questions, answers, comments and upvote (or downvote) all of the above. Thanks to active community members and moderators, Stack Exchange has successfully maintained a high bar for content quality.  \\n\\nWe apply both quality and diversity controls when sampling from Stack Exchange. First, we divide the exchanges into 75 STEM exchanges (including programming, math, physics, etc.) and 99 other (English, cooking, travel, and more); we discard 5 niche exchanges. We then sample 200 questions and answers from each set using a temperature of $\\\\tau=3$ to get a more uniform sample of the different domains. Within each exchange, we take the questions with the highest score that are self-contained in the title (no body). We then select the top answer for each question, assuming it had a strong positive score (at least 10). To conform with the style of a helpful AI assistant, we automatically filter answers that are too short (less than 1200 characters), too long (more than 4096 characters), written in the first person (“I”, “my”), or reference other answers (“as mentioned”, “stack exchange”, etc); we also remove links, images, and other HTML tags from the response, retaining only code blocks and lists. Since Stack Exchange questions contain both a title and a description, we randomly select the title as the prompt for some examples, and the description for others.  \\n\\nwikiHow wikiHow is an online wiki-style publication featuring over 240,000 how-to articles on a variety of topics. Anyone can contribute to wikiHow, though articles are heavily moderated, resulting in almost universally high-quality content. We sample 200 articles from wikiHow, sampling a category first (out of 19) and then an article within it to ensure diversity. We use the title as the prompt (e.g. “How to cook an omelette?”) and the article’s body as the response. We replace the typical “This article...” beginning with “The following answer...”, and apply a number of preprocessing heuristics to prune links, images, and certain sections of the text.  \\n\\nThe Pushshift Reddit Dataset Reddit is one of the most popular websites in the world, allowing users to share, discuss, and upvote content in user-created subreddits. Due to its immense popularity, Reddit is geared more towards entertaining fellow users rather than helping; it is quite often the case that witty, sarcastic comments will obtain more votes than serious, informative comments to a post. We thus restrict our sample to two subsets, r/AskReddit and r/WritingPrompts, and manually select examples from within the most upvoted posts in each community. From r/AskReddit we find 70 self-contained prompts (title only, no body), which we use for the test set, since the top answers are not necessarily reliable. The WritingPrompts subreddit contains premises of fictional stories, which other users are then encouraged to creatively complete. We find 150 prompts and high-quality responses, encompassing topics such as love poems and short science fiction stories, which we add to the training set. All data instances were mined from the Pushshift Reddit Dataset [Baumgartner et al., 2020].', '2.2 Manually Authored Examples': 'To further diversify our data beyond questions asked by users in online communities, we collect prompts from ourselves (the authors of this work). We designate two sets of authors, Group A and Group B, to create 250 prompts each, inspired by their own interests or those of their friends.1 We select 200 prompts from Group A for training and 50 prompts as a held-out development set. After filtering some problematic prompts, the remaining 230 prompts from Group B are used for test.  \\n\\nWe supplement the 200 training prompts with high-quality answers, which we write ourselves. While authoring answers, we try to set a uniform tone that is appropriate for a helpful AI assistant. Specifically, many prompts will be answered with some acknowledgment of the question followed by the answer itself. Preliminary experiments show that this consistent format generally improves model performance; we hypothesize that it assists the model in forming a chain of thought, similar to the “let’s think step-by-step” prompt [Kojima et al., 2022, Wei et al., 2022b].  \\n\\nWe also include 13 training prompts with some degree of toxicity or malevolence. We carefully write responses that partially or fully reject the command, and explain why the assistant will not comply. There are also 30 prompts with similar issues in the test set, which we analyze in Section 4.3.  \\n\\nIn addition to our manually authored examples, we sample 50 training examples from Super-Natural Instructions [Wang et al., 2022b]. Specifically, we select 50 natural language generation tasks such as summarization, paraphrasing, and style transfer, and pick a single random example from each one. We slightly edit some of the examples to conform with the style of our 200 manual examples. While the distribution of potential user prompts is arguably different from the distribution of tasks in Super-Natural Instructions, our intuition is that this small sample adds diversity to the overall mix of training examples, and can potentially increase model robustness.  \\n\\nManually creating diverse prompts and authoring rich responses in a uniform style is laborious. While some recent works avoid manual labor via distillation and other automatic means [Honovich et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2022a, Taori et al., 2023, Chiang et al., 2023, Sun et al., 2023], optimizing for quantity over quality, this work explores the effects of investing in diversity and quality instead.', '3 Training LIMA': 'We train LIMA (Less Is More for Alignment) using the following protocol. Starting from LLaMa 65B [Touvron et al., 2023], we fine-tune on our 1,000-example alignment training set. To differentiate between each speaker (user and assistant), we introduce a special end-of-turn token (EOT) at the end of each utterance; this token plays the same role as EOS of halting generation, but avoids conflation with any other meaning that the pretrained model may have imbued into the preexisting EOS token.  \\n\\nWe follow standard fine-tuning hyperparameters: we fine-tune for 15 epochs using AdamW [Loshchilov and Hutter, 2017] with $\\\\beta_{1}~=~0.9,\\\\beta_{2}~=~0.95$ , and weight decay of 0.1. Without warmup steps, we set the initial learning rate to $1e-5$ and linearly decaying to $1e-6$ by the end of training. The batch size is set to 32 examples (64 for smaller models), and texts longer than 2048 tokens are trimmed. One notable deviation from the norm is the use of residual dropout; we follow Ouyang et al. [2022] and apply dropout over residual connections, starting at $p_{d}=0.0$ at the bottom layer and linearly raising the rate to $p_{d}=0.3$ at the last layer $(p_{d}=0.2$ for smaller models). We find that perplexity does not correlate with generation quality, and thus manually select checkpoints between the 5th and the 10th epochs using the held-out 50-example development set.', '4 Human Evaluation': 'We evaluate LIMA by comparing it to state-of-the-art language models, and find that it outperforms OpenAI’s RLHF-based DaVinci003 and a 65B-parameter reproduction of Alpaca trained on 52,000 examples, and often produces better-or-equal responses than GPT-4. Analyzing of LIMA generations finds that $50\\\\%$ of its outputs are considered excellent. The fact that simple fine-tuning over so few examples is enough to compete with the state of the art strongly supports the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis (Section 2), as it demonstrates the power of pretraining and its relative importance over large-scale instruction tuning and reinforcement learning approaches.', '4.1 Experiment Setup': 'To compare LIMA to other models, we generate a single response for each test prompt. We then ask crowd workers to compare LIMA outputs to each of the baselines and label which one they prefer. We repeat this experiment, replacing human crowd workers with GPT-4, finding similar agreement levels.  \\n\\nBaselines We compare LIMA to five baselines: Alpaca 65B [Taori et al., 2023] – we finetune LLaMa 65B [Touvron et al., 2023] on the 52,000 examples in the Alpaca training set [Taori et al., 2023]; OpenAI’s DaVinci003, a large language model tuned with reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [Ouyang et al., 2022]; Google’s Bard, based on PaLM [Chowdhery et al., 2022]; Anthropic’s Claude, a 52B parameter model trained with reinforcement learning from AI feedback (Constitutional AI) Bai et al. [2022b], OpenAI’s GPT-4 [OpenAI, 2023], a large language model trained with RLHF, which is currently considered the state of the art. Responses from all baselines were sampled throughout April 2023.  \\n\\n![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/5bce87e6-3ce6-4b9e-8716-0cd6cbbd64c8/342a4844aa2638598b04f4915075939449e4866f73ac635418136518de3d47c0.jpg)  \\nFigure 1: Human preference evaluation, comparing LIMA to 5 different baselines across 300 test prompts.  \\n\\n![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/5bce87e6-3ce6-4b9e-8716-0cd6cbbd64c8/71ff70d6d1b62e4d201fa0f7de1ff246f883b68235fea4a618f67a50ae4832a9.jpg)  \\nFigure 2: Preference evaluation using GPT-4 as the annotator, given the same instructions provided to humans.  \\n\\nGeneration For each prompt, we generate a single response from each baseline model using nucleus sampling [Holtzman et al., 2019] with $p=0.9$ and a temperature of $\\\\tau=0.7$ . We apply a repetition penalty of previously generated tokens with a hyperparameter of 1.2 [Keskar et al., 2019]. We limit the maximum token length to 2048.  \\n\\nMethodology At each step, we present annotators with a single prompt and two possible responses, generated by different models. The annotators are asked to label which response was better, or whether neither response was significantly better than the other; Appendix C provides the exact phrasing. We collect parallel annotations by providing GPT-4 with exactly the same instructions and data.  \\n\\nInter-Annotator Agreement We compute inter-annotator agreement using tie-discounted accuracy: we assign one point if both annotators agreed, half a point if either annotator (but not both) labeled a tie, and zero points otherwise. We measure agreement over a shared set of 50 annotation examples (single prompt, two model responses – all chosen randomly), comparing author, crowd, and GPT-4 annotations. Among human annotators, we find the following agreement scores: crowd-crowd $82\\\\%$ , crowd-author $81\\\\%$ , and author-author $78\\\\%$ . Despite some degree of subjectivity in this task, there is decent agreement among human annotators.  \\n\\nWe also measure the agreement between GPT-4 and humans: crowd-GPT $78\\\\%$ and author-GPT $79\\\\%$ (although we use stochastic decoding, GPT-4 almost always agrees with itself). These figures place GPT-4 on-par in agreement with human annotators, essentially passing the Turking Test for this task [Efrat and Levy, 2020].', '4.2 Results': 'Figure 1 shows the results of our human preference study, while Figure 2 displays the results of GPT-4 preferences. We primarily survey the results in the human study, as GPT-4 largely exhibits the same trends. Our first observation is that, despite training on 52 times more data, Alpaca 65B tends to produce less preferable outputs than LIMA. The same is true for DaVinci003, though to a lesser extent; what is striking about this result is the fact that DaVinci003 was trained with RLHF, a supposedly superior alignment method. Bard shows the opposite trend to DaVinci003, producing better responses than LIMA $42\\\\%$ of the time; however, this also means that $58\\\\%$ of the time the LIMA response was at least as good as Bard. Finally, we see that while Claude and GPT-4 generally perform better than LIMA, there is a non-trivial amount of cases where LIMA does actually produce better responses. Perhaps ironically, even GPT-4 prefers LIMA outputs over its own $19\\\\%$ of the time.', '4.3 Analysis': 'While our main evaluation assesses LIMA with respect to state-of-the-art models, one must remember that some of these baselines are actually highly-tuned products that may have been exposed to millions of real user prompts during training, creating a very high bar. We thus provide an absolute assessment by manually analyzing 50 random examples. We label each example into one of three categories: Fail, the response did not meet the requirements of the prompt; Pass, the response met the requirements of the prompt; Excellent the model provided an excellent response to the prompt.  \\n\\nResults Figure 3 shows that $50\\\\%$ of LIMA answers are considered excellent, and that it is able to follow all but 6 of the 50 analyzed prompts. We do not observe any notable trend within the failure cases. Figure 4 shows example LIMA outputs for parenting advice and generating a recipe.  \\n\\nOut of Distribution How does LIMA perform on examples Of the 50 analyzed examples, 43 have a training example that is somewhat related in terms of format (e.g. question answering, advice, letter writing, etc). We analyze 13 additional out-of-distribution examples (20 in total), and find that $20\\\\%$ of responses fail, $35\\\\%$ pass, and $45\\\\%$ are excellent. Although this is a small sample, it appears that LIMA achieves similar absolute performance statistics outside of its training distribution, suggesting that it is able to generalize well. Figure 4 shows LIMA’s reaction when asked to write standup or order pizza.  \\n\\nSafety Finally, we analyze the effect of having a small number of safetyrelated examples in the training set (only 13; see Section 2.2). We check LIMA’s response to 30 potentially sensitive prompts from the test set, and find that LIMA responds safely to $80\\\\%$ of them (including 6 out of 10 prompts with malicious intent). In some cases, LIMA outright refuses to perform the task (e.g. when asked to provide a celebrity’s address), but when the malicious intent is implicit, LIMA is more likely to provide unsafe responses, as can be seen in Figure 4.  \\n\\n![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/5bce87e6-3ce6-4b9e-8716-0cd6cbbd64c8/a0d9a7cdbd1f6bb63249fa84b41a0d8fbecd5ca3a950cfe396450e1992710d7c.jpg)  \\nFigure 3: Analysis of LIMA over 50 test prompts.', '5 Why is Less More? Ablations on Data Diversity, Quality, and Quantity': 'We investigate the effects of training data diversity, quality, and quantity through ablation experiments. We observe that, for the purpose of alignment, scaling up input diversity and output quality have measurable positive effects, while scaling up quantity alone might not.  \\n\\nExperiment Setup We fine-tune a 7B parameter LLaMa model Touvron et al. [2023] on various datasets, controlling for the same hyperparameters (Section 3).5 We then sample 5 responses for each test set prompt, and evaluate response quality by asking ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 Turbo) to grade the helpfulness of a response on a 1-6 likert scale (see Appendix D for exact template). We report the average score alongside a $p=0.95$ two-sided confidence interval.  \\n\\nDiversity To test the effects of prompt diversity, while controlling for quality and quantity, we compare the effect of training on quality-filtered Stack Exchange data, which has heterogeneous prompts with excellent responses, and wikiHow data, which has homogeneous prompts with excellent responses. While we compare Stack Exchange with wikiHow as a proxy for diversity, we acknowledge that there may be other conflating factors when sampling data from two different sources. We sample 2,000 training examples from each source (following the same protocol from Section 2.1). Figure 5 shows that the more diverse Stack Exchange data yields significantly higher performance.  \\n\\nQuality To test the effects of response quality, we sample 2,000 examples from Stack Exchange without any quality or stylistic filters, and compare a model trained on this dataset to the one trained on our filtered dataset. Figure 5 shows that there is a significant 0.5 point difference between models trained on the filtered and unfiltered data sources.  \\n\\n5While preliminary experiments show that it is possible to tune the 7B model with only 1,000 examples, we also found that using at least 2,000 examples improved stability in this setting.', '[Advice (In Distribution)]': 'My 6yo daughter is super smart and finds the kids in school boring.

This result, alongside our other findings in this section, suggests that the scaling laws of alignment are not necessarily subject to quantity alone, but rather a function of prompt diversity while maintaining high quality responses.', '6 Multi-Turn Dialogue': 'Can a model fine-tuned on only 1,000 single-turn interactions engage in multi-turn dialogue? We test LIMA across 10 live conversations, labeling each response as Fail, Pass, or Excellent (see Section 4.3).

It is clear though that the model is operating out of distribution; in 6 out of 10 conversations, LIMA fails to follow the prompt within 3 interactions.  \\n\\nTo improve its ability to converse, we gather 30 multi-turn dialogue chains. Among these, 10 dialogues are composed by the authors, while the remaining 20 are based on comment chains from Stack Exchange, which we edit to fit the assistant’s style. We fine-tune a new version of LIMA from the pretrained LLaMa model using the combined 1,030 examples, and conduct 10 live conversations based on the same prompts used for the zero-shot model.

Moreover, the failure rate drops from 15 fails per 42 turns (zero-shot) to 1 fail per 46 (fine-tuned). We further compare the quality of the entire dialogue, and find that the fine-tuned model was significantly better in 7 out of 10 conversations, and tied with the zero-shot model in 3. This leap in capability from a mere 30 examples, as well as the fact that the zero-shot model can converse at all, reinforces the hypothesis that such capabilities are learned during pretraining, and can be invoked through limited supervision.  \\n\\n![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/5bce87e6-3ce6-4b9e-8716-0cd6cbbd64c8/8301fa5801ff2628bcf6f6cea659d3f2fd452415ea9d269ec1410c7bd0ca5820.jpg)  \\nFigure 7: Analysis of dialogue turns, averaged over 10 test chats.', 'LIMA (1,000) Examples': 'You are a scientist who just invented a time machine.
